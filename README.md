## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

I first made the html and sass code, getting ready the elements i would manipulate with vue and worked down to the javascript functionality before making the site responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Sass
- Vue

### What I learned

I really learnt to use vue more in this project. The manipulations of the DOM elements would have been much more harder if not for using Vue. And i had a hard time coming up with the logic fo the theme and how to render them to users if they already had a certain theme present in their browser. In summary it was a fun project to do
